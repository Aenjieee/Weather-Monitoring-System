The Weather Monitoring System is an IoT-based solution that collects real-time environmental data from sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and other weather parameters. Using an Arduino-based setup integrated with IoT platforms, this system provides accurate weather information that can be viewed through a user-friendly interface.

Features:
- Real-time weather data collection (temperature, humidity, pressure)
- IoT integration for remote monitoring
- API-based weather data retrieval
- Animation-based data visualization (for future enhancements)
- Data storage and logging for historical analysis
- 
System Architecture
Sensors:

- Arduino-based sensors: DHT11/DHT22 for temperature and humidity, BMP180/BMP280 for atmospheric pressure.
Microcontroller:

- Arduino Uno or any compatible board for sensor data reading.
IoT Integration:

- Communication with platforms such as ThingSpeak, Blynk, or custom server solutions for remote data access.
Weather APIs:

- Integration with services like OpenWeatherMap to fetch current weather data.
